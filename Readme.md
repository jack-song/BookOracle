## Notes

- merge goodreads lists and sort by: frequency of appearance, "stand out score", average rating
- pull inner page for rating for better flexibility in handling different kinds of lists, and potentially pulling other information, though slower
- pagination / lazy loading must be handled manually (links for different pages, using the print view)

- No API: Most API methods require you to have for a developer key. As of December 8th 2020, Goodreads no longer issues new developer keys for our public developer API and plans to retire the current version of these tools. You can find more information here. (https://www.goodreads.com/api)
